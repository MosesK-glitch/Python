# Python Functions
# They are a block of code/statements that performs a given task/action. They can be reused through out the program to perform different tasks.
# Functions are defined using def keyword. (define)
# We have two main types of functions i.e:
# 1. In-built functions -> They come preinstalled with the interpreter  i.e print(), pop(), range(), append() etc...
# 2. User defined functions => They are created by a programmer to solve a given task.
# To define a function you need to give it a name followed by parenthesis.
# For the functions, it is usually indented and to invoke a function we use the function name.
 
def greetings():
    print("Hello, how are you?")

# below we call the function by use of its name.
